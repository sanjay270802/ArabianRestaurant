                <span>Providing Fresh Sea-Food</span>
                <p>Regularly eating seafood benefits several aspects of your health due to the many important vitamins
                    and minerals seafood contains. </p>
                <p>Seafood is a healthful choice for people of all ages—
                    growing children, pregnant women, active adults, and
                    the elderly. Seafood is an excellent source of lean, high
                    quality, easily digested protein. A 3.5-ounce serving of
                    seafood provides almost half of an adult’s daily protein
                    needs for only 100 to 200 calories. Seafood is low in saturated fat and sodium and is a rich source
                    of many essential vitamins and minerals. Seafood also is one of the few
                    foods that contain long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, which
                    have many beneficial health effects and are essential for
                    the development of the nervous system and retina.</p>

                <p>
                    Promote your table reservation system: encourage people to book a table so you know how many clients
                    you will be serving. This will allow you to plan the food and schedule employees for the best
                    customer experience.
                </p>
                <p>Have procedures in place for every type of situation: everyone working at the restaurant is only
                    human and errors can occur. An order may be forgotten, or it may be wrong. However, the way
                    employees react to these situations can save a situation and still satisfy customers. Create
                    procedures for every type of possible event, so your employees know how they should react;</p>
                <p>Ensure fair treatment and scheduling: if employees are unhappy with how they are treated, they won't
                    be motivated to offer clients a great customer experience. Therefore, take all measures to help them
                    feel satisfied with their job such as fair scheduling, benefits, and time off when they need it;</p>
